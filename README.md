# Anomaly-Detection-with-Pycaret-Power-BI

This is a project I learned for Anomaly Detection using Pycaret by Moez Ali. It is a great way to check for outliers in your dataset with a very few steps. 

The link to the tutorial for this is - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgr_3iXORmo&t=3559s

For the Power BI report, the link to the article is - https://towardsdatascience.com/build-your-first-anomaly-detector-in-power-bi-using-pycaret-2b41b363244e

It is great way to learn and plot anomalies and also to push it to production. 

Part 1 and 2 contain the Pycaret example in Python.
The Power BI file contains an interactive report that shows Anomalies according to various Merchants, Departments, etc. 

The Dataset used for Part 2 and the Power BI report is also uploaded.
